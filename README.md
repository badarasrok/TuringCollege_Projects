Task Description
You got a follow-up task from your product manager to give stats on how subscription churn looks 
from a weekly retention standpoint. Your PM argues that viewing retention numbers on a monthly 
basis takes too long and important insights from data might be missed out.

You remember learning previously that cohort analysis can be really helpful in such cases. 
You should provide weekly subscription data that shows how many subscribers started their 
subscription in a particular week and how many remain active in the following 6 weeks. 
Your end result should show weekly retention cohorts for each week of data available in 
the dataset and their retention from week 0 to week 6. Assume that you are doing this analysis on 2021-02-07.

The task for product analyst sprint

You have a follow up task from your product manager to identify how 
much time it takes for a user to make a purchase on your website. 
Your PM would like to see the users' duration from first arriving 
on the website on any given day until their first purchase on that same day. 
Your final result should show the duration dynamic daily.

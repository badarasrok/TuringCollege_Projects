The task for A/B testing part of the sprint

You have a follow-up task from your marketing manager. She does not trust 
the A/B test data you calculated previously looking at “NewYear” and “BlackFriday” 
campaigns and testing if versions had significantly different clickthrough rates (Clicks/Impressions). 
She thinks that the clicks were not tracked properly and those numbers are wrong, 
though she trusts that the number of impressions is correct.

She asks you to come up with an alternative way to estimate how many people actually clicked 
on those banners from marketing “NewYear” and “BlackFriday” campaigns.
